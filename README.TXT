Lab V  Classes and Inheritance

Due the Saturday after the lab meeting at 8 A.M.

This exercise involves class definitions and inheritance and method
overriding.

Author is a class to represent writers.

WorkOfLiterature is an abstract class to represent novels, plays, and 
poems.

Poem extends WorkOfLiterature
Play extends WorkOfLiterature
Novel(which you must code in its entirety) extends WorkOfLiterature

WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO

1. code the toString() method in Author as specified there
2. code the toString() method in Poem as specified there
3. code the constructor in Play
4. code the whole class for Novel; you can use the other classes
as models

When you have completed your work, email me a compressed file containing
all five classes.  Identify the team members who worked on the 
exercise in the Author class.
